backbone-share
=========

An adapter for backbone models and collections on top of sharejs documents

Currently almost at a 0.1 release, pending code cleanup, comments, and the completion of an example project at [https://github.com/steveorsomethin/umlol](https://github.com/steveorsomethin/umlol).
A simple example project can be found in the form of a collaborative Todos app, in /examples.

A build system is still in progress, so if you want to see the source, simply look in build/backbone-share.js.

Proper documentation will be completed along with an initial release.
